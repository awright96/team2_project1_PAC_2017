\Large {\bf Scheduling for Tasks with Dependencies}

\large Scheduling on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) is a crucial problem with
applications in areas such as task scheduling, parallel processing, and
workflow distributions. We propose the search for a Fixed Parameter Tractable
(FPT) algorithm for scheduling with dependencies. The problem as stated is:

\defproblem{Makespan scheduling on Directed Acyclic Graph}%
{A directed graph $G = \{V, E\}$ with a function $W_v: V \to \mathbb{R}$,
 where $W_v$ is vertex weights, and a set of identical machines,
$M$}%
{Tree width of $G = k$}%
{Is there a Fixed Parameter Tractable algorithm parameterized by tree width
which  minimizes the makespan while respecting
dependencies?}%

What is an optimal assignment of tasks to minimize the time to execute all of
the tasks?
