Makespan scheduling with DAG

\begin{tabular}{ l l }
	DAG $G = (V,E)$~ & workflow to be scheduled\\
	Vertex $v \in V$ & tasks in workflow \\
	Edge $(u,v) \in E$ & dependencies of tasks \\
	                   & ~~task $v$ relies on $u$\\
	Vertex Weight $w_v$ & required Processing Time for $v$\\
	Machine $M$ & machines to run tasks on\\
\end{tabular}


\textbf{Objective:} Find an assignment of tasks to machines $\mathcal{M}$ $\rightarrow$ total
time to completion is minimized

\textbf{Open Questions}: a FPT algorithm for this problem?

%\large Scheduling on Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) is a crucial problem with
%applications in areas such as task scheduling, parallel processing, and
%workflow distributions. We propose the search for a Fixed Parameter Tractable
%(FPT) algorithm for scheduling with dependencies. The problem as stated is:

%\defproblem{Makespan scheduling on Directed Acyclic Graph}%
%{A directed graph $G = \{V, E\}$ with a function $W_v: V \to \mathbb{R}$,
% where $W_v$ is vertex weights, and a set of identical machines,
%$M$}%
%{Tree width of $G = k$}%
%{Is there a Fixed Parameter Tractable algorithm parameterized by tree width
%which  minimizes the makespan while respecting
%dependencies}%
