\textbf{Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)}

Graph consisting of a set of directed edges with
no cycles

\textbf{Fixed Parameter Tractable (FPT)}

A problem is FPT if when parameterized by
parameter $k$, there is an algorithm with runtime $f(k) n^{O(1)}$.

\textbf{Makespan}: The total amount of time required for a set of tasks to complete,
starting at the beginning of the first task, ending with the completion of the
last.
