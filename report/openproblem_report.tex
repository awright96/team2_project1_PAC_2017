\section{Introduction}
Scheduling on Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) is a crucial problem whose 
applications can be found in many ways, such task scheduling in parallel 
systems and workflow distributions. Typically, an optimal scheduling 
would on a DAG would lead to a minimized completion time,
reduced costs. etc. Due to the significance of this problem, it has been 
extensively studies. Challenges arise when it comes to find an optimal solution 
to this problem, as this problem is NP-hard, finding an optimal solution may 
often be computationally prohibitive to find. 

Although many works have been carried out to find an solution to this, most 
of those work rely on heuristic methods (e.g. HEFT\cite{keylist}) or 
meta-heuristics (e.g. generic algorithms) to solve this problem. 
While those problems may work well under some conditions, 
it cannot always promise to find an efficient answer.  

One alternative solution is to come up with an Fixed Parameter Tractable 
(FPT)
algorithm to solve this problem. However, to the best of our knowledge,
there is no FPT available 
no FPT-hardness (?) result is given for this problem.

\section{Open Problem Description}
The open problem we identified is makespan scheduling on a DAG.
Given a weighted Directed Acyclic Graph $G=(V,E)$, the vertex
$v \in V$ denotes a task to be executed, while the weight on $v$ 
stands for the execution time. A directed edge on $G$ reflects
dependencies among tasks, an edge from vertex $u$ to $v$
means task $v$ cannot be started unless $u$ has been processed. 
Our objective is, given M identical machines, we want find out the execution
orders for those tasks in order minimize the time to completion.

\defproblem{Makespan scheduling on Directed Acyclic Graph}%
{A directed graph $G = \{V, E\}$ with a function $W_v: V \to \mathbb{R}$,
 where $W_v$ is vertex weights, and a set of identical machines,
$M$}%
{}%
{Is there a Fixed Parameter Tractable algorithm parameterized by tree width
which  minimizes the makespan while respecting
dependencies?}%

A candidate to be used as a parameter is M, the total number of machines
we have. Another parameter we would consider would be treewidth.

\section{Related Questions Works}
To the best our knowledge, the FPT hardness result and solutions to the 
makespan scheduling for DAG is still open. 
However, this problems is closely related to makespan scheduling, which
is proven to be $w[1]$-hard, and a FPT-algorithm is presented to solve
this problem within $O(?)$ time.



\section{Special Cases (and potential solutions?)}
Case 1: $k = 1$ or $k >= |treewidth|$
Case 2: makespan scheduling.
